# Natural++ VS Code Extension

Official language support for Natural++, the modern, English-like compiler built to replace cryptical C++ syntax!

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for Natural++ keywords \`create\`, \`variable\`, \`if\`, \`otherwise\`, \`while\`, \`display\`, etc.
- Smart suggestions for data programming (\`list\`, \`add to\`) and object-oriented programming (\`object\`, \`property\`).
- Comments highlight \`note:\` statements.

## Usage

Create a new file with the \`.npp\` or \`.natural\` extension and start coding in pure English:

\`\`\`natural
create variable max_score equal to 100
create variable current equal to 0

while current is less than max_score do
display current
set current to current plus 10
end while
\`\`\`

## Running Natural++

You can run your code natively through the [Natural++ Online IDE](https://github.com/Vimlesh-Kumar/natural-plus-pluse) or the compiled C++ engine natively on your system!
